# Thought Cloud

## Description
Thought Cloud is a backend only social media framework. It enables users to run a simplified social media platform using a backend software such as Insomnia. Thought Cloud can be used to create new users, update, their information, and delete them. The same can be done with "thoughts" which are this platform's version of posts. Reactions can also be added to thoughts and users can have friends added to and removed from their account. This project was powered by mongoDB, mongoose, and express.
